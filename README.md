# ARCHIVED!
This repository has been archived and replaced by the fll-timer.com [website](http://fll-timer.com) and 
[repository](https://github.com/dhmmjoph/fll-timer.com). The code in this repository 
(especially the timers for non-FLL competitions) mostly works, but there are some interesting bugs in the automatic reset
code. Those bugs have been fixed in the new repo.
